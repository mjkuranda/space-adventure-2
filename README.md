# Space Adventure II

## About
The second edition of Space Adventure game.
This Game is about spaceship that traverses the universe and need to face different threats.
Space Adventure II was inspired retro style and my beloved synth music genre.

## Technologies
* Java
* Slick2D

## Motivation
I was deeply focused on using design patterns and good practices to create this game.
Also, I wanted very much to create game based on retro style.

## Development
* Create maven configuration with command: `clean install jar:jar`
* Create application configuration with vm options: `-Djava.library.path="lib"`.
* Fill in `Working directory` and `Path to JAR`.

The project uses JDK20 (JDK 20.0.1) and Slick2D game library based on LWJGL.
